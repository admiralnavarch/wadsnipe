# WADSNIPE

> hi, ty for testing wadsnipe, here is some info before u start:
> wadsnipe is obfuscated (encrypted) just to protect the code
> wadsnipe requires your discord token so that it can scan thru multliple channels in the app while u go about your day, so it does not need to stay open nor on the channel you want to snipe in
> wadsnipe does not save any data entered, any data entered is saved ONLY locally (on your pc)
> do not leak wadsnipe until it is completely done, in which you can forward people to the wadsnipe server
> if you do not trust wadsnipe, simply do not use it!
> to change the sound that plays, create a new mp3 file in the folder, name it sound, and delete the old one

how to set up wadsnipe
> Open the folder
> Run wadsnipe.py
> If you have not ran wadsnipe before, it will ask you for some config settings
> Enter your token
> Enter the IDs of the channels you want to snipe, when you are done, leave it blank and hit enter again
