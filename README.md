# WADSNIPE

wadsnipe runs on python, u should prolly get it first

hi, ty for testing wadsnipe, here is some info before u start:
1. wadsnipe is obfuscated (encrypted) just to protect the code
2. wadsnipe requires your discord token so that it can scan thru multliple channels in the app while u go about your day, so it does not need to stay open nor on the channel you want to snipe in
3. wadsnipe does not save any data entered, any data entered is saved ONLY locally (on your pc)
4. do not leak wadsnipe until it is completely done, in which you can forward people to the wadsnipe server
5. if you do not trust wadsnipe, simply do not use it!
6. to change the sound that plays, create a new mp3 file in the folder, name it sound, and delete the old one

how to set up wadsnipe
1. Open the folder
2. Run wadsnipe.py
3. If you have not ran wadsnipe before, it will ask you for some config settings
4. Enter your token
5. Enter the IDs of the channels you want to snipe, when you are done, leave it blank and hit enter again
